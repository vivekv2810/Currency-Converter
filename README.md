## 🎯 Aim
- Convert currency from one unit to another dynamically.
- Support multiple currencies.
- Provide real-time exchange rates using an external API.

## 🛠️ Installation and Setup

### Vanilla JavaScript Version

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/currency-converter.git
   cd currency-converter

2. Open ```index.html``` in your browser:

```open index.html```

## React JS Version

1. Clone the repository:
   
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/currency-converter-react.git
cd currency-converter-react
```

2. Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

3. Run the app:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

4. Open the app in your browser at ```http://localhost:3000```.

## 🔑 API Integration

To use real-time exchange rates, you need an API key from a currency exchange API service (e.g., ExchangeRate-API).

1. Register for an API key.

2. Replace ```'your-api-key-here'``` in the JavaScript or React code with your actual API key.

## ✨ Future Improvements

- **Add more currencies**: Expand the list of available currencies by dynamically fetching from the API.
